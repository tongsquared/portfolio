This is my first public portfolio with Tell Stories With Data.

# About me
Hello! I am a student at Tell Stories With Data. I am a second year MSPPM graduate student at Heinz college, Carnegie Mellon University. I have a background in Financial Economcis and Statistics. From the first year at Heinz, I took some data mining and data processing courses as well as some strategy development courses. After graduation, I envision myself doing Data Analytical related jobs and hence want to take this course to enhance my data visulization skills. 

I think Data Visulization is a crucial part of reports/PPT because they can present what's behind the data. From the first class, I realized the importance of how minor things have great impact on the overall delivery such as color and the size of the contents. I have used pie charts, histogram and boxplot in many projects, but was not very clear on how to display them when it comes to choosing colors, proportions and which gragh to choose. 

Thus I am very much looking forward to learning about some common mistakes people make in visulizing datas and strategies to apply when it comes different situations to better visulize data. 

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about how to create meaningful and statistical significant data visulizations, as a way to supplement my data analytical results and help me with the Explorary Data Analysis part in data processing. 

More specifically, how to use minimal color to reflect meaingful informations. For instance, I was unware of some extreme color schemas does not work for the color blind people and in this case we might need to apply some geometric distinctions.
