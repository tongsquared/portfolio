# About me
Hello! I am a student at Tell Stories With Data. I am a second year MSPPM graduate student at Heinz college, Carnegie Mellon University. I have a background in Financial Economcis and Statistics. From the first year at Heinz, I took some data mining and data processing courses as well as some strategy development courses. After graduation, I envision myself doing Data Analytical related jobs and hence want to take this course to enhance my data visulization skills. 
I think Data Visulization is a crucial part of reports/PPT because they can present what's behind the data. From the first class, I realized the importance of how minor things have great impact on the overall delivery such as color and the size of the contents. Thus I am very much looking forward to this course and the final project that I will be delivering. 
# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn about how to create meaningful and statistical significant data visulizations, as a way to supplement my data analytical results and help me with the Explorary Data Analysis part in data processing.
