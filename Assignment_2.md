In this assignment, I will present three visulizations of data from OECD. I will explain each of them based on the their advantages and disadvantages. 
<h4 class="h3">This chart intends to show the government debt of OECD countries in the year of 2014.</h4>
Background: There are 10 OECD countries in this graph. The bar height represents how much the government debt is taken up to the overall country GDP. There are two highlighted bars with numbers at the top of each of them in this graphic: Red and Blue. The red bar refers to the Sweden and the blue bar refers to the United States. I color coded Sweden because its Debt-To-GDP ratio is 64% which is said to be the ideal Debt-To-GDP ratio, so I highlighted it red to mark it a standard for audience to compare. I highlighted the United States blue because I am contrasting US's DTI ratio to the standard and the rest of OECD countries. 
Advantages: The advantages of visulizing data with the bar chart are: first it's clear to see US's DTI position in terms of all OECD countries as well as compared to the ideal standard since only two colors are present in this graphic. The rest countries are colored as light blue, marking a sharp contrast. 
Disafvantages: However I was not able to customize the y labels to add percentile to the label to convery more intuitive information. Secondly, the graphic seem a bit crowded with many OECD countries. If less countries are shown, they this grahic is more concise and clear in terms of converying meaningful information. Lastly, this graphic only convey DTI ratio information on year 2014 instead of showing a trend of growth or decline.

<h4 class="h3">This graphic represents a visulization of Government Debt of OECD countries from 1995 to 2019.</h4>
Background: There are 16 OECD countries represented in this graph, in other words, 16 small graphs in the overall graphic. Each line represents the yearly growth of each country's debt-to-gdp ratio.
Advantages: This graphic shows a complete trend of DTI growth of OECD countries from 1996 to 2020. It allows the audience to explicitly see the increase or the decrease of DTI ratio of every country and compare them accordingly 
Disadvantage: They are 16 different grid graphs which couldn't make a immediate comparsion among coutries accross time. If there could be a way to highlight US or the values, it would convery a more clear comparision.

<h4 class="h3">This chart intends to show the government debt of OECD countries from 1996 to 2020 in Tableau.</h4>
Background: This map indicates the DTI growth of each country with different saturation colors, while organe indicating a higher value and blue a lower value.
Advantages: This graphic solved problems of previous two graphics. It can not only show the trend but also in a intuitive way. 
Disadvantage: I think the information is still a bit too much. For instance there are a bit excessive countries represented in this graph and the year length(from 1996 to 2020) makes the length of the graphic excessively long as well. If to revise, I think adjusting the number of the coutries being represented and the year interval would deliver a more concise graphic.
