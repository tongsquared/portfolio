As the final part of the project, I will record all the changes made to the prior version and summarize this project after receiving some comments and advices from my classmates
and professors. <br />
Porgess:<br />
**How did I receive comments/advices**: From group critiques, my teammates suggested me that I should enrich my stories and make the storyline clear throughout the entire story. Because
my primary purpose is to acknowledge people about the current status of shelter animals and encourage those to adopt over purchase pets, I need to list evidence of shelter animals
needing our attentions in the forms of real stories. Additionally, I met with professor to discuss possible improvements on my project. Professor suggested to me that I should ask 
myself why I decided to do this topic and what do I want to achieve. I then realized what might be missing for me to tell a meaningful story. 
**What did I change:** I reached out to my friend who was the president of one animal rescue team in Beijing for getting more statistics and orginal photos as my sources. I adjusted
the order my story. The outline now is updated as following:<br />
1. Introduction page ( original photo of a stray cat taken by the rescue team )
2. Starting story of why I want to do this topic: A photo of my own pet, purchased from a breeder. I will explain that I thought about adopting another pet from the shelter in PA 
since COVID. However I wish to make the point that I purchased a pet. <br />
3. Introductary statistical page of overall shelter animals in the US : data presented by APSCA
4. Statistics exploring the outcomes of the shelter animals:
5. Story of a senior dog being abandoned and readopted: real story from ASCPA 
6. Introduce the point that people are more likely to adopt kittens and puppies. 
7. Story of xiaohua, an twice abandoned dog who were poorly treated by his owner after him purchaisng a good greed dog
