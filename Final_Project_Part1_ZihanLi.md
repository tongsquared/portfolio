<h4 class="h3">Outline</h4><br/>
For my final project, I'd like to use shorthand to dliver a website to present the results of animals left the shelters to encourage people to adopt animals instead of buying animals.<br/>
I chose topic because as a pet owner myself, I have gotten to know some shelter animals' living conditions. I wish to use this website to acknowledge people who wish to own a pet about the current situation that shelter animals are facing. 
Some major elements my project will include are: <br/>
1. Shelter Animals Outcomes after adoptions <br/>
2. Important Factors to A Successful Adoption <br/>
3. Emphasis of "Compassion over Fashion" and "Adopting over Purchasing" Visulizations.
