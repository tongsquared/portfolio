<h4 class="h3">Outline</h4><br/>
For my final project, I'd like to use shorthand to deliver a website to present the results of animals left the shelters to encourage people to adopt animals instead of buying animals.<br/>
I chose this topic because as a pet owner myself, I have gotten to know some shelter animals' living conditions as well as shelter animals. I wish to use this website to acknowledge people who wish to own a pet about the current situation that shelter animals are facing. 
Some major elements my project will include are: <br/>
1. Shelter Animals Outcomes after adoptions <br/>
2. Important Factors to A Successful Adoption <br/>
3. Emphasis of "Compassion over Fashion" and "Adopting over Purchasing" Visulizations.

<h4 class="h3">Data Documentation</h4><br/>
I acquired this dataset from kaggle and plan to plot some exploraory charts with this dataset. There are eight variables in this dataset: <br/>
ID, Name, DateTime, AnimalType, SexuponOutcome, AgeuponOutcome, Breed, Color <br/>
I chose this dataset because there are many valueable information here. For instance I can explore how does breed affect shelter animal outcomes, and how does age affect shelter animal outcomes. These graphics would reveal some correlations between certain factors and shelter animal outcomes. By revealing these information to the audience, they might consider more comprehensively while adopting a shelter animal. 
Here is the link to the dataset:

I will use shorthand to create a story including some graphcis as well as some photos from news.
